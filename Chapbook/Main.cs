You smiled when Prose did, cried when she didn't. You walked away weary out into the night. That's where you met Poetry. A flicker in the dark there and gone again. She wore sleek, form-fitting clothes so unlike the long, graceful lines of Prose. Then she hit you. She came from behind, threw you against the wall you walked along. You crumbled, beginning to fall, but she pulled you up by the throat. Her grip loosened, her hand flowed up your cheek, her head tilted just so. That's when you saw her face. \"Fierce\" doesn't begin to describe her. \"Lethal\" is more apt a term for Poetry. Her mouth a bloody, deadly smile. Her eyes, though. They held no malice, a scalpel instead of a knife. Loving, yet no less sharp. No less willing to cut, to hurt. She whispered something in your ear. You couldn't make out the words, jumbled and strange, a far cry from the Prose you love. Those words though. They cut and battered you. They held you tight. They gave you hope, they crushed it. They carried joy without comedy, despair without tragedy, meaning without reason. Even now, as you lay in bed, you struggle to remember what Poetry said.

Sweat, glistening, nourishing, slides off our backs, quenching the dry riverbeds gouged in our skin. Tears, opaline, cleansing, run down our cheeks, welding the fissures set in our faces. We stand scarred, tested, hurt.

The surface bubbles and gurgles, sprays vile magma far above, too hot to stand upon, and intangible regardless. If you lived that long (you wouldn't, couldn't) you would sink under the unimaginable weight of your own body, dragged under by billions of silently screaming bits of dust. Less than dust, really, more like singed ground-air (one and the same, here) that cries out without a medium to cry into. That's the most pleasant layer of hell. Through the not-floor you find helium mixed with hydrogen (that's what burns, you see) and slowly fall to carbon and neon. Hotter, now. Hotter still the deeper you fall, pulled through air so dense it feels like molasses yet a pull so strong you still sink faster than a fishing weight in the ocean. It would rip you apart, but you must have been long dead when you arrived. The heat and all. And the radiation. Four, five, six layers past. Hotter, yet not all that different-new elements but they burn the same-before you land feet first (or whatever is left of your body to land, likely your heavy jewelry or any ceramics you were carrying when you died) You land on iron (still molten, but so dense you sink like quicksand rather than open water). You lie not yet in the lowest layer, the layer where the power of hell resides, the layer where the heat is made, where even the air or water or dust goes to die. Die, and be reborn, and reborn, and reborn unto iron. All things die here, but this hell is not only necessary for life, it is the origin of it. A great spherical hell stretches across the sky of our world, a threat and a solemn promise to kill. To kill any that come near, to kill the atoms of its own flesh, to kill itself and us, in time.
